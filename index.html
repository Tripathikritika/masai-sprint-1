                        <p  class="float">Frederick Joseph "Fred" Flintstone, once known as Fred W. Flintstone, is a fictional character of the original series, 
                        The Flintstones and the rest of the franchise.Fred Flintstone was the prehistoric dad in the animated comedy.He was the  main character of the animated sitcom The Flintstones, which aired during prime-time on ABC 
                        during the original series' run from 1960 to 1966. Fred is the handsome husband of Wilma, father of Pebbles and best friend of Barney Rubble, 
                        who lives at his house in Bedrock, at 345 Cave Stone Road (in some episodes, 1313 Cobblestone Way or 222 Rocky Way).
                        Fred Flintstone's most famous and iconic catchphrase is "Yabba-Dabba-Doo!", which is also heard at the beginning of the theme song, 
                        "Meet the Flintstones" and the film plus the rest of the franchise. </p>
                        <h3> Personality</h3>
                        <p class="float">Fred's personality was based on that of Ralph Kramden of the 1950s television series The Honeymooners and Chester A. 
                            Riley from The Life of Riley. Thus, much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, offensive, and constantly scheming 
                            ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Archie Bunker of All in the Family & 
                            Archie Bunker's Place and George Jefferson of The Jeffersons also have similar personalities based on Fred Flintstone. Due to his impulsive, 
                            aggressive, immature, childish and ill-tempered behavior and obstinate and naive nature, Fred Flintstone seems to be accident-prone. 
                            He is able to create the biggest confusion, even with the most innocent and mundane action.
                            Fred is mainly a kind and generous man, although he gets mad and angry quite a lot, usually when his immature friend Barney pesters and teases Fred, 
                            or even laughs at him by going. Other than that, Fred can have other emotions too. His laugh is "Ho, heh, he, he, he, he".
                        </p>
                        <h3>Positive Quality</h3>
                        <p class="float"> Despite his apparently anti-social character, Fred's actions are shown to be usually free of any malice. And, although he almost 
                            constantly screams and irritates the people around him, Fred proves to be a friendly person; often going out of his way to help someone.
                            Although Fred often bugs Wilma with his immaturity, he proves to be a very caring and loving husband and father. 
                            Flintstone is even known to go to great lengths to please his family or owe somebody an apology when he goes too far.</p>

                            <h3>Relationships</h3>
                            <p class="float"> According to The Flintstone Kids (which is non-canon as the show is more 80s-centric and features all the characters knowing each other as kids, but still features the accurate names of the parents of characters such as Wilma's),
                                 he is shown to be the son of Ed and Edna Flintstone. Fred was the grandson of famed Stone War I hero Rockbottom "Rocky" Flintstone. Fred also had a good relationship with his father, sharing his toys with him as a child and even receiving his first razor from him.
                                 The Flintstone family came from "Arkanstone" where they had been engaged in a feud with the "Hatrock" family which had been caused by an ancestor of Fred's making a wisecrack of a Hatrock family portrait ("I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting but he should have gotten life").
